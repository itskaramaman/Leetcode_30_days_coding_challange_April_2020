# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

# Example:

# Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
# Follow up:

# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

# Solution (This Algorithm is Kadane's Algorithm)
